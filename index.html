      <li>What is an HTML tag?</li>
        <p>An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML document</p>

      <li>What are the three parts of an HTML element? (image from paragraph)</li>
        <p>An HTML element has opening tag, content and closing tag.</p>

      <li>What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?</li>
        <p>The doctype purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document.</p>
    
      <li>What is the HTML element?</li>
        <p>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document.</p>

      <li>What is the purpose of the head element?</li>
        <p>The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.</p>
    
      <li>What is the purpose of the body element?</li>
        <p>The <body> tag defines the document's body. The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document.</p>

      <li>How do you create a paragraph in HTML?</li>
        <p>We type the paragraph start tag. Then type the paragraph's text. At the end of the new paragraph's text, we type the end tag.</p>
      
      <li>How do you create a heading in HTML?</li>
        <p>We use any of the heading tags and every tag will give us the different size of the heading.</p>
    
      <li>How many different levels of headings are there and what is the difference between
        them?
        </li>
        <p>HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.</p>

      <li>What element should you use to make text bold and important?</li>
        <p>The HTML b element defines bold text</p>

      <li>What element should you use to make text italicized to add emphasis to it?</li>
        <p>To italicize the text in HTML, use either the em tag or the i (italics) tag. Both of these tags will italicize the text, but the em tag additionally indicates that the text has stress emphasis when read.</p>
    
      <li>What relationship does an element have with any nested elements within it?</li>
        <p>When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child relationship between them. The nested elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.</p>
    
      <li>What relationship do two elements have if they are at the same level of nesting?</li>
        <p>Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be siblings </p>
    
      <li>How do you create HTML comments?</li>
        <p>To comment out in HTML, we insert information between < ! -- and -- > tags</p>
      
      <li>What HTML tag is used to create an unordered list?</li>
        <p>The < ul > HTML element represents an unordered list of items</p>
      
      <li>What HTML tag is used to create an ordered list?</li>
        <p>The < ol > HTML element represents an ordered list of items</p>

      <li>What HTML tag is used to create list items within both unordered and ordered lists?</li>
        <p>The < li > HTML element create list items within both unordered and ordered lists</li></p>
      
      <li>What element is used to create a link?</li>
        <p>The < a > HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</p>
      
      <li>What is an attribute?</li>
        <p></p>  <!--missing answer-->

      <li>What attribute tells links where to go?</li>
        <p>The hypertext reference, or href , attribute is used to specify a target or destination for the anchor element.</p>

      <li>What is the difference between an absolute and relative link?</li>
        <p>The main difference between absolute and relative paths is that absolute URLs always include the domain name of the site with http://www. Relative links show the path to the file or refer to the file itself. A relative URL is useful within a site to transfer a user from point to point within the same domain.</p>

      <li>Which element is used to display an image?</li>
        <p>The < img > element is used to display an image. </p>

      <li>What two attributes do images always need to have?</li>
        <p>The img element has two required attributes: src : The source location (URL) of the image file. alt : The alternate text. This is used to describe the image for someone who cannot see it because they are either using a screen reader or the image src is missing.</p>
